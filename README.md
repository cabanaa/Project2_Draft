# Project2_Draft
This is my project 2 draft.
The files that are included are the P0DTC2 fasta file which is the spike protein and the P03451 fasta file which is the Hemagglutinin protein.
My jupyter notebook that includes my first draft for my project 2 is also included.
The scientific question for my project 2 is : What is the relationship between the SARS-COV-2 spike protein and the Influenza spike protein?
The scientific hypothesis for my project 2 is :  If the sequences between the two spike proteins match, then it means that they are a similar virus.
